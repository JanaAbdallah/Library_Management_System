How to Set Up the Project
Prerequisites
Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio (Community edition is free).

SQL Server: Install SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Database Setup:

Create a database named Library in SQL Server.

Run the following SQL scripts to create the required tables:

sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE BOOK (
    ISBN BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title NVARCHAR(100),
    Genre NVARCHAR(50),
    PublishYear INT,
    Price BIGINT,
    NumCopies INT
);

CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNumber NVARCHAR(15),
    Email NVARCHAR(100),
    Country NVARCHAR(50),
    City NVARCHAR(50),
    Street NVARCHAR(100),
    BirthYear INT,
    BirthMonth INT,
    BirthDay INT,
    Age INT
);

CREATE TABLE AUTHOR (
    AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Name NVARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE WRITE (
    ISBN BIGINT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES BOOK(ISBN),
    AuthorID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES AUTHOR(AuthorID),
    PRIMARY KEY (ISBN, AuthorID)
);
